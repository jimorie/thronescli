Thrones CLI
===========

A command line interface for browsing cards from [A Game of Thrones LCG 2nd Ed](https://www.fantasyflightgames.com/en/products/a-game-of-thrones-the-card-game-second-edition/).

Why?
----

[Thronesdb.com](http://thronesdb.com/) is a great web site, but sometimes it's just nice to do things from the command line.

Thrones CLI also has the ability produce card count breakdowns based on a selected field, with the --count option.

Install
-------

Thrones CLI can be installed from [PyPI](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/thronescli) using pip:

    sudo pip install thronescli

If you download the Python script from [here on GitHub](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jimorie/thronescli/master/thronescli/thronescli.py) note that there is a third-party dependency on the [Click framework](http://click.pocoo.org/).
